# **Data Structures Implementation in C**

## **Overview**

This repository contains the implementation of fundamental **data structures** in **C language**. The goal of this project is to provide practical, hands-on experience with common data structures, their operations, and their real-world applications.

The following data structures are implemented:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly)
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

## **About**

This project is part of my coursework in **Data Structures** at **Dedan Kimathi University of Technology**. It demonstrates the practical implementation of various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables. This project is intended to help understand their implementation and how these data structures are applied in solving real-world computational problems efficiently.

Each data structure is implemented with the standard operations like **insertion**, **deletion**, **searching**, and **traversal**. The primary goal of this project is to give hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of how data structures work and how to manipulate them in C.

## **Implementation Details**

Each data structure is implemented in a separate file for clarity. Below is a brief overview of the implemented structures:

- **Arrays**: Basic array implementation with operations like insertion, deletion, and searching.
- **Linked Lists**: Implementation of both singly and doubly linked lists, including operations like inserting, deleting, and traversing nodes.
- **Stacks**: Stack implementation using arrays with operations such as push, pop, and peek.
- **Queues**: Queue implementation, supporting both regular and circular queues, with enqueue, dequeue, and front operations.
- **Trees**: Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree implementations with functions for insertion, traversal (pre-order, in-order, post-order), and deletion.
- **Graphs**: Graph implementation using an adjacency matrix and adjacency list, supporting depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).
- **Hash Tables**: Hash table with collision resolution using chaining (linked lists).

Each data structure has corresponding header files (`.h`) that contain the function prototypes and structure definitions.

## **Installation**

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

### 1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ODARI-CHARLES1/data-structures-implementation-c.git
```

### 2. **Navigate to the project directory**

```bash
cd data-structures-implementation-c
```

### 3. **Compile the C files**

You can compile any individual C file using `gcc` (GNU Compiler Collection) or another C compiler. For example, to compile the array implementation:

```bash
gcc arrays/array.c -o array
```

This will compile the `array.c` file and create an executable named `array`.

### 4. **Run the program**

After compiling, you can run the program using:

```bash
./array
```

Make sure to adjust the path if you are compiling other data structure files.

## **Usage**

The project demonstrates various data structures in C. Here are examples of how to use each data structure:

### Example: Linked List (Singly)

```c
#include "linked_list.h"

int main() {
    List *list = create_list();
    insert_at_end(list, 10);
    insert_at_end(list, 20);
    insert_at_beginning(list, 5);
    display(list);
    return 0;
}
```

Each data structure has a corresponding `main()` function in its directory to test the functionality.
